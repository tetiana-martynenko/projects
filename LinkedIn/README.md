LinkedIn Project Analysis Description

The project analyzes job postings on LinkedIn to identify trends in the job market, salary structures, and the effectiveness of application methods. 
The goal is to provide recommendations for improving the LinkedIn platform and help job seekers navigate the job market. 
The analysis uses the LinkedIn Job Postings Dataset, which includes information on 123,849 job listings from April 2024 in the USA.

Tools used: Python, MySQL, Tableau.
Source: LinkedIn Job Postings Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings/data)
Format: 8 CSV tables.
Number of records: 123,849 job postings.

Key features:
Job title: e.g., "Data Scientist", "Software Engineer".
Employment type: mostly full-time (80%), part-time (10%), and the rest are contract, internship, or temporary.
Salary range: median salary varies from $52,000 to $193,000.
Highest salaries: $193,000 for executive roles.
Presence of salary in the job posting increases the conversion rate by over 2%.
Industries: Leading sectors include IT services, Sales, and Management (around 30% of job postings).
Benefits: 35% of job postings offer retirement savings (401(k)).
Overall conversion rate: 6.5%.

Conclusions:
- Real estate has the largest differences between minimum and maximum salaries. This can be explained by commission-based payments, which are common in this industry.
Legal, healthcare, and IT sectors lead in the number of positions with average salaries above $200,000. These sectors also have high conversion rates, indicating high demand for such positions.
- Retail and manufacturing sectors have a significant share of jobs with salaries under $50,000 per year (around 40%). This suggests basic qualifications or underpaid labor in these fields.
- The most competitive positions are in IT at mid and executive levels, with 7 applications per vacancy on average.
- Job postings offering additional benefits like retirement savings (401(k)) have higher conversion rates, showing that these benefits are attractive to candidates.
- High salaries are typically found in law, healthcare, and IT sectors. The IT sector has many high-paying jobs, but about 12% of positions offer low salaries, which allows beginners to enter the field.
  
Recommendations:
1. Optimize Job Postings in Major Sectors:
The real estate and communications sectors have large salary fluctuations. It is recommended to standardize salaries in these sectors to reduce uncertainty.
Blockchain and other new technologies have high instability, so itâ€™s worth considering stabilizing compensation packages to attract more candidates.
2. Improve Job Descriptions:
Create clearer and more targeted job postings for specific audiences. This will help reduce salary fluctuations and minimize uncertainty in pay.
3. Improve Working Conditions and Benefits:
Offering benefits like retirement savings (401(k)) should be expanded across more job postings. This will make job listings more attractive and increase conversion rates.
Sectors with low conversion rates, like retail and manufacturing, should improve their working conditions and offer more benefits to attract candidates.
4. Manage Market Competition:
To reduce competition in the most popular sectors (IT), consider supporting programs for beginners to make it easier to enter these fields.
Focus on mid-level positions as they have high conversion rates and demand.
5. Expand Application Sources:
SimpleOnsiteApply needs analysis and simplification of the application process, as the low number of sources and applications indicates its inefficiency.
